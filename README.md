# Semantic Web Query Web Client

## Utilizing D3.js to visualize the data from the Java webservice endpoint

Currently we are testing with JSON file that is returned from the swq_viz_jena's web service. <br>
linkedData.json has the sample JSON file with a query we have performed for "Great Britain". <br>
<br>
index.html has the D3.js logic to parse the JSON and create the graph.
search.html has the landing page with search bar and button to call search.
